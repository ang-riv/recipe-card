## My process

- Start with the mobile version, using Chrome inspector on 320px screen size.
- Add in all the html elements, working from the biggest sections to the individual elements.
- Arranging text in the appropriate element.
- Add the empty css blocks in order of how the classes/elements appear in the html
- Figure out how to spacing around the bigger sections then smaller elements like list items. Usually working from top to bottom and with in each section of the recipe card.
- Add in some of the styles from the style guide and adjust when needed for font sizes, spacing, etc.
- Work on media queries/ tablet and desktop versions.
- ! Keeping the styles from mobile that have 100% width on everything, look at the desktop design and pick a width that looks similar to the desktop design doc. In this example, I used 700px. Then use Chrome inspector to change screen width to 700px and set the max-width of the main card to 700px. Use the parent element (body) and turn it into a flex container to center the recipe card.
- Used border-radius to round out the corners of the recipe card as well as the image.
- Look through and clean up code.
- Host on Github pages.
